# SteamInviteHelper-ASF
## Introduction
This plugin allow you to set rules and actions for your incoming friend invites. The bot can automatically block, ignore or accept the incoming friend invites base on the set rules.

I made this plugin mainly for personal use. It use to be a stand-alone program, but I figure instead of having a seperate program running in the backgroud, it will be more elegant to just integrate it into ASF, since I always have ASF runing anyways.
