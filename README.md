### There seemed to be bug preventing the plugin to load correctly. If you encounter any errors please copy `ArchiSteamFarm.dll` in the same directory as the plugin's dll. You can find `ArchiSteamFarm.dll` under ArchiSteamFarm's root directory.
## Introduction
This plugin allow you to set rules and actions for your incoming friend invites. The bot can automatically block, ignore or accept the incoming friend invites base on the set rules.

I made this plugin mainly for personal use. It use to be a stand-alone program, but I figure instead of having a seperate program running in the backgroud, it will be more elegant to just integrate it into ASF, since I always have ASF runing anyways.

## Installation
+ Download the zip file from the latest release
+ Unpack the zip file to the `plugins` folder. The directory structure should be `plugins\SteamInviteHelper-ASF\SteamInviteHelper-ASF.dll`
+ Start ASF. If you see the welcome text from the plugin, you are good to go!

## Configuration
Please refer to the [wiki page](https://github.com/1461748123/SteamInviteHelper-ASF/wiki/Configuration).
